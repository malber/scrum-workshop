# scrum-workshop
This repository includes Scrum / Agile workshops run at conferences, or trainings.
The goal of this repository is to make the material as accessible as possible to any trainer.

## Folder Structure 
The workshops I carried out so far were mostly divided in two phases:
- A presentation about Scrum
- The engaging workshop itself, where participants play in teams

This is reflected in the structure of the folders.
If you are planning a training, the idea is that you can interchangeably use whatever presentation and workshop you prefer.

## Note on licensing
As per licensing agreement, you can basically re-use all the material as much as you want.
The only catch is that you cannot use it to make a profit.
