# scrum-workshop
This repository includes Scrum / Agile workshops run by [Patricia Malanda](https://ch.linkedin.com/pub/patricia-malanda/3/492/752) and myself, [Mattia Albergante](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mattia-albergante/26/a33/737) at conferences, or trainings.
The short-term goal of this repository is to make our material as accessible as possible to any trainer.
The longer-term dream would be to
- Improve our trainings with suggestions / requests / pull requests (!!) from other contributors
- Include third-party trainings

## Folder Structure 
The workshops I carried out so far were mostly divided in two phases:
- A presentation about Scrum
- The engaging workshop itself, where participants play in teams

This is reflected in the structure of the folders.
If you are planning a training, the idea is that you can interchangeably use whatever presentation and workshop you prefer.

## Note on licensing
As per licensing agreement, you can basically re-use all the material as much as you want.
The only catch is that you cannot use it to make a profit.
