# The plan

The idea behind this workshop is that, quite simply, you have an empty house and you want it furnished.

## The execution
Divide the room in teams of maximum 6 people.
Each team is made of:
- 1 PO
- 1 Scrum Master
- 3 Developers

You can play with the number of developers to make smaller, or bigger teams.

## The backlog
The backlog is to be created by the trainer.
I have put an example in the folder, and it can clearly be seen some traps usually found in user stories
- Vague requirements (unclear color...)
- Stories too big / too small
It is interesting to note how participants have always made remarks about it, and therefore the role of the major stakeholder (see below) is very important.

The example in the folder can be transformed to pdf with a simple tool provided by some amazing developer at Ableton : https://github.com/csk-ableton/pivotal2pdf

The pdf from the csv in the current folder is already created and attached for your convenience.

## The tools
Any tool can be used:
-  Pre-created stickies, each with a piece of furniture (plus additional ones that can be created by the people)
-  Legos

I personally use the Ikea home planner: http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_JP/rooms_ideas/splashplanners.html 
It's easy to use, it's engaging and we've all used it!

Make sure you get the permission to use this from Ikea, of course, before using this.

Once you get the permission, here's two rooms that should be publicly accessible and that you can use together with the backlog above
- Kitchen: http://kitchenplanner.ikea.com/JP/UI/Pages/VPUI.htm?Lang=en-GB&LoadDesign=0c34ffef707c4b9d88a8f7e227bf8751&UIContext=Kitchen&IsSharedDesign=1
- Dining room: http://kitchenplanner.ikea.com/JP/UI/Pages/VPUI.htm?Lang=en-GB&LoadDesign=0c34ffef707c4b9d88a8f7e227bf8751&UIContext=Kitchen&IsSharedDesign=1

## The roles
### Main stakeholder
I usually play this role.
I am available to the PO for clarifications, for directions and for open feedback (also during demos).

### Product Owner
- Writes, removes, add cards to product backlog
- Cannot do the above for sprint backlog by his initiative
- Can clarify sprint backlog / change cards if requested by the team

### Scrum Master
- Ensures rules are respected
- Can remove impediments (install software, â€¦)
- Can challenge team decisions

### Developer
- Can touch the computer
- Can put and remove items into/from the room
- Can make decisions for items non-clearly stated
- Can always ask the PO for clarifications
