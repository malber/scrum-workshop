# The plan

The idea behind this workshop is that, quite simply, you have an empty house and you want it furnished.

## The execution
Divide the room in teams of maximum 6 people.
Each team is made of:
- 1 PO
- 1 Scrum Master
- 3 Developers

You can play with the number of developers to make smaller, or bigger teams.

## The backlog

## The tools
Any tool can be used:
-  Pre-created stickies, each with a piece of furniture (plus additional ones that can be created by the people)
-  Legos

I personally use the Ikea home planner: http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_JP/rooms_ideas/splashplanners.html 
It's easy to use, it's engaging and we've all used it!

Make sure you get the permission to use this from Ikea, of course, before using this.

Once you get the permission, here's two rooms that should be publicly accessible and that you can use together with the backlog above
- Kitchen: http://kitchenplanner.ikea.com/JP/UI/Pages/VPUI.htm?Lang=en-GB&LoadDesign=0c34ffef707c4b9d88a8f7e227bf8751&UIContext=Kitchen&IsSharedDesign=1
- Dining room: http://kitchenplanner.ikea.com/JP/UI/Pages/VPUI.htm?Lang=en-GB&LoadDesign=0c34ffef707c4b9d88a8f7e227bf8751&UIContext=Kitchen&IsSharedDesign=1
